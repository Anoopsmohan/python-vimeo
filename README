This a python module for using Vimeo's API.

The current code uses old v1 API, which is deprecated, and goind fo retirement soon.
I should rewrite nearly everything for the v2:
 http://vimeo.com/api/docs/methods

It is not supporting the whole API, for the simple reason that I don't
have time for this.  But most of the methods would simply be a matter
of copy/paste, so anyone willing the support for a new methods can
contribue, patches are welcome !

Currently, the needed stuff for uploading is supported and works fine.


INSTALL
-------

Regular python distutils:

 $ python setup.py install prefix=/somewhere/in/the/universe

You can also create debian package:

 $ dpkg-buildpackage

And you can even use prebuilt packages for ubuntu, available on my ppa:
  https://launchpad.net/~marc-poulhies/+archive/ppa

Currently, I only built the packages for the Jaunty version. Simply
add the following lines in /etc/apt/sources.list or in a separate file
in /etc/apt/sources.list.d:

,----
| deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/marc-poulhies/ppa/ubuntu jaunty main 
| deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/marc-poulhies/ppa/ubuntu jaunty main 
`----

USAGE
-----

The vimeo-upload.py script is an example of how to use the python API
to upload a single video.

This is a sample use of the script:

 $ vimeo-upload.py -k API_KEY -s API_SECRET -t AUTH_TOKEN  -f toto.avi -n "toto"

Known bugs:
 - can't use space inside title or tags. I should look into it.
