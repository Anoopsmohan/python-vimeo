This a python module for using Vimeo's API.

This is a complete rewrite of the previous version. Support
for v2 API is underway. Currently, do not expect anything.

For debugging purprose, I heavily rely on hurl (http://hurl.it/).
The author of this website is also the author of the python module for oauth used here.
